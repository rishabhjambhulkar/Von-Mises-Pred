# Von-Mises-Pred
# Thesis Project under Dr. Rajiv Sharma | Design and Simulation Lab, Ocean Engg Department| IIT Madras
# • Data is generated using Python programming based on Von-Mises Formulation.
# • Von-Mises stress of underwater pressure vessel (stiffened and unstiffened cylinder) is predicted using Decision Trees, # Ensemble Models and
# Neural Network.
# • All models are compared and analyzed data required to train the model.
