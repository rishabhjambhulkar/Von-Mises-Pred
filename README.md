## 1. The Submarine Hull features a hollow cylindrical structure, with Von-Mises stress influenced by factors such as radius, length, thickness, and operable depth, among others.
## 2. The aim of employing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) is to establish correlations between these parameters and determine their respective feature importance.
## 3. Predictions of Von-Mises stress are made using various models like polynomial regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and Neural Network, achieving an impressive 99 percent accuracy.
## 4. Analysis of the results reveals that the primary and crucial features influencing Von-Mises stress are the radius, length, thickness, and operable depth of the submarine hull.
